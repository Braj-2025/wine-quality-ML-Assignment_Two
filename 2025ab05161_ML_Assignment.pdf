Observations on the performance of each model on the chosen

ML Model Name			Observation about model performance
Logistic Regression		Works well but limited by linear assumption.
Decision Tree			Captures non-linear patterns but slightly overfits.
kNN				Sensitive to scaling and dataset size.
Naive Bayes			Fast but assumes feature independence.
Random Forest			Strong accuracy, reduces overfitting via ensemble learning.
XGBoost				Best overall performance due to boosting and optimization.
